👋 Hi, I'm @dethreb
👀 I'm interested in blending UX design with research-driven insights to create experiences that actually make sense to humans. My superpower is turning complex user needs into clean, intuitive designs that even your grandmother could navigate.
🌱 I'm currently learning how to audit AI systems through the lens of human values (check out my NeurIPS 2024 paper!) and expanding my React skills to build more dynamic prototypes.
💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on innovative projects where UX isn't just an afterthought. Especially interested in AI-powered tools, emergency response systems, or anything that solves real human problems.

⚡ Fun fact: I once led the redesign of emergency response operator maps to integrate AI drone capabilities - meaning I've literally helped design systems that save lives. When not designing interfaces, I'm designing strategies to beat my friends at board games with suspiciously well-thought-out user flows.
